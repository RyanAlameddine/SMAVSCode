# SMA VSCODE README

VSCode extension that adds syntax highlighting, hover information, and other useful tools for the StanModeArchitecture, an assembly language designed for fun by me. For more information on SMA, check out my StanModeArchitecture github repo. This is for educational purposes only, not for actual use.
